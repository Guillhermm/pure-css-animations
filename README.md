# Pure CSS Animations

A collection of small animations and visual experiments built using only HTML and CSS.

This repository is focused on exploring motion, shape, and visual behavior without any JavaScript.
Each animation is self-contained and lives in its own directory.

No JavaScript. No frameworks. No external libraries.

## Animations

All animations are located in the `animations/` directory.

Each folder contains:

- a minimal HTML file
- a CSS file with the animation logic
- assets and/or documentation

The animations are also available as live demos on CodePen.

## Notes

These animations were created as experiments and learning exercises.
The code prioritizes clarity and visual exploration over abstraction or reuse.
