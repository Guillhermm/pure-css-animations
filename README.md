# Pure CSS Animations

A collection of small animations and visual experiments built using only HTML and CSS, with focus on exploring motion, shape, and visual behavior without any JavaScript.

Each animation/experiment is self-contained and lives in its own directory, and can be run independently.  
No frameworks. No build tools. No dependencies.

## Experiments

## Notes

These projects are experimental and intended for learning and exploration.  
They are not production-ready components but demonstrate CSS animation techniques, interactive visuals, and creative UI patterns.
