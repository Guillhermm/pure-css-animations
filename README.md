# Pure CSS Animations

This repository contains few animations I have created over the years to improve my skills in HMTL + CSS.

## Liquid Dance Shape

This animation creates a "liquid dance" effect using keyframe animations. The animation features a liquid blob that changes shape and moves in a fluid, dance-like motion, using pure CSS with no JavaScript.

### Features:
- **Morphing Shape**: The blob changes its shape dynamically, shifting from round to more organic forms.
- **Dancing Motion**: The shape moves in a circular pattern, simulating a fluid dance.
- **Gradient Color Effects**: The shape is filled with a vibrant, glowing radial gradient, making it visually striking against a dark background.
