# Wave

A smooth, fluid wave animation using CSS keyframes and gradients.

This animation demonstrates how to create a dynamic, organic wave effect entirely with CSS.

- **Ripple Layering**: Additional gradient layers simulate depth and movement.
- **Gradient Effects**: Subtle color blending gives a glowing, water-like appearance.
