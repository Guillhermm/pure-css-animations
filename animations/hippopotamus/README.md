# Hippopotamus

A playful, animated hippo illustration created entirely with CSS.

This animation demonstrates how CSS can be used to build and animate complex shapes and characters without any JavaScript.

## Features

- **Character Design**: Full hippo made with divs and CSS shapes.
- **Subtle Animations**: Breathing effect, ear wiggle, and blinking eyes add life to the character.
- **Interactive Details**: Hovering over the nose and teeth triggers small animations for extra fun.
- **Pure CSS**: No JavaScript required — everything is handled with HTML + CSS.
