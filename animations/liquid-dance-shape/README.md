# Liquid Dance Shape

A colorful, fluid "blob" animation that dances and morphs using only CSS.

This animation showcases how keyframe animations can be combined to create dynamic, organic motion without JavaScript.

## Features

- **Morphing Shape**: The blob continuously changes its border-radius, creating a fluid, organic form.
- **Dancing Motion**: Subtle rotation and translation create a dancing effect.
- **Gradient Glow**: Radial gradient with a soft glow gives the shape a vibrant, luminous look.
- **Pure CSS**: No JavaScript or external libraries, this is, everything is handled with HTML + CSS.
