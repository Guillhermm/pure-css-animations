# Dark Theme

A modern, CSS-only dark mode demo built with semantic HTML and Material-inspired design tokens.

This project demonstrates how to implement a fully functional dark/light theme toggle **without any JavaScript**, using the `<input type="checkbox">` hack combined with CSS variables.

## Features

- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle themes with a pure CSS switch using `:checked` and CSS variables.
- **Material-Inspired Design**: Surface elevations, accent colors, and typography inspired by Material Design.
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid system and components adapt to mobile and desktop screens.
- **Interactive Components**: Cards, buttons, and feature items animate subtly on hover.
- **CSS-Only Implementation**: No JavaScript; theme switching is handled entirely by CSS.
- **Accessibility & Usability**: Reduced eye strain in low-light environments and visually distinct color schemes.

## Notes
